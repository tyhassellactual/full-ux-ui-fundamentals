	  	  <h2 id="recruiting-content-header">How to Transform Your Recruitment Process</h2>
	  	  <p>In today's hyper-competitive job market, organizations are fighting an ongoing "talent war," where the key to winning lies in identifying, attracting, and retaining high-potential individuals. The mantra <i>"hire for talent, train for skill"</i> has emerged as a game-changing approach, enabling companies to tap into candidates with raw potential and mold them to meet specific business needs. Stay ahead of the talent war by taking these 9 steps.</p>
	  	  <br>
	  	  <br>
	  	</div>
  	  <h3 id="step-1-header">Step 1: Redefine the Job Description</h3>
  	  <div id="step-1-content">
	  	  <p>Traditional job descriptions and resume culling models prioritize specific degrees, certifications, or technical skills. Sometimes prioritizing the amount of time one has spent developing or utilizing a skill. To attract the top talent that will fit your team and create a culture of high-performance your company should focus on identifying the inate qualities needed to excel in a role. This is not saying forget about the technical, but who cares if I have a degree and 7+ years experience if I already perform at a high level and can easily meet and exceed the standard extremely quickly or the moment I walk in?
	  	  </p>
  	  	<ul id="step-1-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<p>Rewrite job descriptions to emphasize soft skills as well as hard technical skills. Adaptability, problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and creativity are generally perfect examples of what to be looking for in a high-performing team player. <i>Example: Instead of requiring "5 years experience in digital marketing," request instead "ability to innovate and develop compelling marketing strategies in a dynamic enviroment."</i>
  	  			</p>
  	  		</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-2-header">Step 2: Build an Employer Brand</h3>
  	  <div id="step-2-content">
	  	  <p>When you think of companies that have "dream jobs," there is a reason. Their <strong>BRAND</strong> makes them a dream employer. Talented individuals gravitate toward organizations with a strong, appealing brand. As a company, you must position yourself to be an employer of choice, instead of an employer of opportunity.
	  	  </p>
  	  	<ul id="step-2-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<p>Invest in showcasing the company culture, values, and employee success stories through social media, blogs, and testimonials. Partner with employees to create authentic, positive narratives about the workplace. If you are asking what your culture is, how your values matter to employees, or don't know any of your employees' success stories...this is your culture check. Get the pulse before moving on.
  	  			</p>
  	  		</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-3-header">Step 3: Develop Strategic Recruitment Channels</h3>
  	  <div id="step-3-content">
	  	  <p>Focusing on specific degree paths from prestigious programs may be a safe bet when it comes to educational pedigree, but there are more ways to find talent that will stay and grow your company, Top talent doesn't alwasy emerge from traditional places or recruitment platforms. Your company must adopt strategies to find the "diamonds in the rough" and the "hidden gems" of your industry.
	  	  </p>
  	  	<ul id="step-3-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<ul id="step3-action-list" style="list-style-type: none;">
  	  				<li>   1) Employee referrals can be a great source of a stream of loyal, talented, and hard-working employees.</li>
  	  				<li>   2) Host industry recognized events to find and attract professionals that are passionate about their craft. Reference <a href="https://youtu.be/lWUm1pCgo6U?si=TeGSYs__JeqKU_5b">Hackathons</a> for the Tech industry!</li>
  	  				<li>   3) Do engage with universities, fundamentals/upskilling programs, "bootcamps," or industry break-in events to identify high-potential individuals early.</li>
  	  			</ul>
  	  		</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-4-header">Step 4: Assess for Potential, not Credentials</h3>
  	  <div id="step-4-content">
	  	  <p>Resumes can be misleading. An over-reliance on formal qualifications will easily have you missing out on promising candidates that will lead an industry/career field through your company if given the opportunity. Focus on evaluating talent through methods that reveal true potential, not just current contributor ability.
	  	  </p>
  	  	<ul id="step-4-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<ul id="step4-action-list" style="list-style-type: none;">
  	  				<li>   1) Use behavioral interviews to assess traits like resilience, leadership, and learning ability instead of only focusing on technical/role proficiency</li>
  	  				<li>   2) Incorporate assessments like problem-solving, case study assessment, or situational judgement tests.</li>
  	  				<li>   3) Apply gamification techniques within an interview to uncover adaptability, creative-thinking, and competitiveness.</li>
  	  			</ul>
  	  		</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-5-header">Step 5: Embrace Inclusive Talent Hiring</h3>
  	  <div id="step-5-content">
  	  	<p>We think that D.E.I. initiatives are a systemic issue amongst enterprise profitability. D.E.I for the sake of what it is and to "prove" that you aren't racist, sexist, homophobic, or whatever defeats the purpose and dilutes your talent pool to lower perfroming individuals that are all very different from each other. However, if you look around and don't see much diversity in your talent pool, ask yourself "Why are all of our employees 'X'?", and really lean into changing that. Much like we believe that America's strength comes from out immigrants, we believe that diversity amongst your ranks increases your opportunities to gain future business when you embrace the culture of another, and use that as fuel for personal and professional growth. 
  	  	</p>
  	  	<ul id="step-5-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<p>Eliminate the biases in recruitment by using automated systems. If you are like us and think that AI driven screening tools may eliminate highly-talented candidates, use them to wash identifiable information from a resume when someone gets their hands on it. Use your current diversity in your workforce to promote open communication of what brought the candidates to your company, and how you can be culturally diverse, inclusive, and how their culture can positively influence your workplace!
  	  			</p>
  	  		</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-6-header">Step 6: Prioritize Learning & Development</h3>
  	  <div id="step-6-content">
	  	  <p>While development is its own part of winning the talent war, it is a part of recruitment as well. When talent is at your doorstep, they should know that they are going to grow while working with you. They don't have to look at your position as a stepping stone to another position somewhere else. They should know that career longevity, personal and professional growth, and they will be a better *insert whatever role or career field progressive job you want* a year, two yers, five years after coming onboard than they are now. How to do this will be covered on the <a href="development.html">Developement</a> page.
	  	  </p>
  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-7-header">Step 7: Offer Competitive Total Rewards</h3>
  	  <div id="step-7-content">
	  	  <p>Cash may be KING...but talented individuals look beyond salary when choosing their employer. Compensation is more than just money, PTO, health, and dental. Holistic approaches to total reward packages are a part of retention also, and they'll be gone over in detail on the <a href="retention.html">Retention</a> page. People have diverse needs, and a holistic approach to employee benefit packages could be the turning point in a candidate's journey to help you win them as a talent and propel them into the future.

  	  </div>
  	  <h3 id="step-8-header">Step 8: Create a Culture of Engagement and Retention</h3>
  	  <div id="step-8-content">
	  	  <p>Retention will be covered <a href="retention.html">HERE</a>, but engagement matters. Motivation and the allure and shiny attraction to a new job fades. Developing a strong culture committed to excellence and the organization's mission is crucial.
	  	  </p>
  	  	<ul id="step-8-list">
  	  		<li>Action Point: 
  	  			<ul id="step8-action-list" style="list-style-type: none;">
  	  				<li>   1) Encourage regular feedback from one-on-one meetings a anonymous surveys...actually take actions on feedback please.</li>
  	  				<li>   2) Recognize and reward employees for their contributions top to bottom...and do it publically.</li>
  	  				<li>   3) Empower employees to feel a sense of ownership so that they feel valued and know their opportunities for growth lies with the growth of the organization.</li>
  	  			</ul>

  	  <h3 id="step-9-header">Step 9: Continuously Innovate Talent Strategies</h3>

  	  	<p>In an ever-evoloving world where technology, human resources, education, hard and soft-skill development change seemingly by the hour sometimes, adapt and stay ahead of the curve.

  	  		<li>Action Point:

  	  				<li>   1) Employ and retain great data analytics pros.</li>
  	  				<li>   2) Set benchmarks against competitors and yourself to identify gaps in strategies.</li>
